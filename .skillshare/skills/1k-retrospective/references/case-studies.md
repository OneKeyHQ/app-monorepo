## Case: iOS OneKey ID logout dialog stuck with loading spinner
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Platforms**: iOS (native)
**Symptom**: After clicking logout in OneKey ID page, the confirmation dialog showed a permanent loading spinner and never closed, even after the modal behind it was dismissed.
**Root Cause**: Race condition between explicit logout (Dialog onConfirm) and automatic `handleLoggedOutWhileFocused` effect. When `apiLogout()` updated `primePersistAtom`, the effect fired and called `popModalPagesOnNative()` while the dialog's `onConfirm` was still executing, orphaning the dialog.
**Fix**: Added `isExplicitLogoutRef` flag set via `onBeforeLogout` callback before `logout()` starts, preventing `handleLoggedOutWhileFocused` from interfering with user-initiated logout.
**Catchable by**: Section 5: No race conditions in async operations

## Case: Web header settings dropdown overlap
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Platforms**: Web
**Symptom**: In the web header settings dropdown, clicking currency then language (or vice versa) caused both Select floating panels to appear simultaneously, overlapping.
**Root Cause**: Two `Select` components inside a `Popover` managed their own `isOpen` state independently. Opening one did not close the other.
**Fix**: Extracted popover content into `MoreDappActionContent` with key-based mutual exclusion. When one Select opens, the other is force-remounted (closed) by incrementing its key.
**Catchable by**: NEW — not covered (UI component interaction within shared container)

## Case: Perps history tab title highlighted when share dialog opens
**Date**: 2026-02-26 | **Platforms**: iOS, Android (native)
**Symptom**: When opening the share position dialog from the history page, the tab header text got visually highlighted/selected.
**Root Cause**: Tab header `SizableText` and `XStack` elements lacked `userSelect="none"`, allowing text selection when focus shifted to the dialog.
**Fix**: Added `userSelect="none"` to `XStack` and `SizableText` in both `PerpTradersHistoryListModal` TabHeader and `PerpOrderInfoPanel` TabBarItem.
**Catchable by**: Section 1: Code Quality — UI interactive elements should have userSelect="none"

## Case: Web language dropdown stays open when clicking Settings
**Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Platforms**: Web
**Symptom**: In the DappHeader MoreDappAction popover, opening the language Select dropdown then clicking "Settings" left the dropdown visible while the Settings modal opened.
**Root Cause**: `SettingListItem` only called `closePopover()` to close the parent Popover, but due to `keepChildrenMounted`, the child `LanguageListItem`'s Select stayed mounted with `isOpen=true`.
**Fix**: Added `closeAllDropdowns` callback in `MoreDappActionContent` that bumps keys for both Language and Currency Selects (forcing remount and state reset), called via `onBeforeNavigate` prop before `closePopover()`.
**Catchable by**: Section 5: No stale state after parent container dismissal (related to existing case "Web header settings dropdown overlap")

## Case: Keyless avatar provider fallback
**Date**: 2026-03-12 | **Platforms**: mobile, desktop, web, extension
**Symptom**: Keyless wallet avatar badge could show the original login provider instead of the provider parsed for avatar display.
**Root Cause**: Wallet avatar rendering only read `keylessProvider`, while the refreshed avatar-specific provider was not persisted or prioritized.
**Fix**: Stored `avatarProvider` in `keylessDetails` during avatar repair and updated avatar rendering to prefer `avatarProvider` before falling back to `keylessProvider`.
**Catchable by**: Section 4: Type definitions changed -> all consumers updated
